## Never put your github tokens into version control
##
## go to github.com and login
## go to your newsfeed, and find the subscribe link
## your private token is visable in the URL
## 
## copy the token into ~/.gitrsstoken 
## only the 32 char token, none of the URL is required
##
## If your dotfiles are in source control, add .gitrsstoken to your gitignore
